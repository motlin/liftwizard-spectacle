## Agenda
* Demo of temporal services
* Focus on what, more than why or how
* Except for this intro: brief discuss of goals
---

## Define temporal
* Edits are non-destructive
* All previous versions of the data are saved and accessible
* Technically: unitemporal
* Out of scope: bitemporal
---

## Goals
* Add temporal features to our real services (already started)
* Build interest in unitemporal services in data
* Start thinking about the future of framework support
---

## My Timeline
* 2009 - 2015: Worked temporal applications, then temporal frameworks
* 2016: UI lead quit, needed to learn react, built factorio-blueprints site
* 2017: Website becomes popular
* Also 2017: Joined TS in Data Engineering, working on a bitemporal data platform. Exposure to MSSQL temporal features.
* 2018: Joined SLIC as the tech lead
